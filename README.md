## Features
1. Cloth simulation by means of a mass spring system, including dampening.
2. Wind simulation by calculating wind forces per triangle.
3. Interaction with rigid spheres.
4. Tearable cloth based on maximum spring stretching (rather unstable at the moment).

## Controls
- Zoom in and out with + and - keys.
- Rotate around cloth with the mouse.
- Play/pause simulation with the spacebar.
- Reset the cloth with the R key.
- Make the cloth tearable/untearable with the T key, show tears or not with the S key.
- Enable/disable wind force and ball position with the W and B keys respectively.
- Use 1, 2, 3 and 4 to individually make the corners of the cloth static or dynamic.
